# BankAppAnimation

BankApp is a mobile banking interface where users can view and manage multiple cards, switch between them, and track individual transactions.
This app was developed independently as a way to practice SwiftUI, animations, and component-based architecture. It combines several concepts learned from different tutorials and custom design decisions.

# Features
- **Card Management**<br>
Add and switch between multiple debit/credit cards.

- **Interactive UI**<br>
Tap to flip through cards with smooth transitions.

- **Transaction List**<br>
View individual card expenses with service icons, categories, and prices.

- **Custom Styling**<br>
Gradient backgrounds, rounded elements, and modern component layout.

- **Secure Input UI**<br>
Number pad to enter card details and scan options.

# Tech Stack
üåê SwiftUI: Declarative UI for modern iOS apps.<br>
üì± Xcode: Apple's IDE for Swift development.

# Learnings
While building this app, I learned how to:

- Create dynamic and responsive card UIs using SwiftUI stacks and animations;
- Manage multiple UI states with @State, @Binding and view model logic;
- Use lists and custom rows to display transaction history;
- Design a custom numeric keypad for secure card entry;
- Apply reusable view components and modifiers for consistent UI;
- Handle conditional rendering and smooth transitions between views;
